# Multiverse-Matchmaker
*Swipe through Marvel’s Multiverse. Chat with your destiny.*

## Project Idea

Multiverse Matchmaker is an AI-powered web app where users describe themselves, and the AI generates fun alternate versions of them across different universes. But the twist? You also get matched with Marvel characters like Wanda, Loki, or Peter Parker—who actually chat back. It's part game, part roleplay, part multiverse dating simulator.
